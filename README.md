# 🎯 Breakout

Breakout is a 🎨 JavaScript game that helped me learn complex concepts in game development I learned a lot while building this project 🧠

## 🏆 About the Game
🎮 The game takes place inside a box containing blocks and a ball<br/>
🏗️ When the ball touches a block, the block disappears, and you earn points 🏅<br/>
⚠️ If you fail to catch the ball and it falls below the box, you lose the game ❌<br/>

## 🚧 Current Limitations
❌ The game does not work on PC <br/>
🎨 The CSS UI is very basic<br/>

## 🔮 Future Improvements
💻 Add support for PC<br/>
🎨 Improve the UI with better CSS styling<br/>
